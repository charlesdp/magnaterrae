  name: "Dominique from Journiac, France. "
  description: He solely does an Organic Grape Juice but he definitely knows how.
  story: "I live in the area of Bordeaux where grape cultivation is part of our local identity. Most of the growers produce wine. I prefer to make juice. It is easier and requires less material. I make my grape pressed in the Chateau Puy-Servain, not far from my land. I supply my products to the various hotels of the region. It is pretty popular for breakfast."

  name: "Monique, Rochepaule, France."
  description: She solely does an Artisanal Cherry Nectar but she definitely knows how.
  story: "I'm not professional grower but we have a large garden with a forty-something cherry trees. It has been 10 years that we bring them to the press in the region and make nectars out of it. We sell locally but the success is such that have recently replanted and hope to increase our volumes. Nice idea since we are now starting to sell in England. Cherry’s cultivation fits particularly well to Ardeche’s land and climate."

  name: "Mathieu from Gilly-sur-Isère, France."
  description: Amongst all of his products, we have selected the Organic Apple & Blackberry Juice and the Organic Apple & Blackcurrant Juice.
  story: "Gilly-sur-Isere is located on the edge of the Alps and Switzerland, in the department of Savoie. We switched to organic agriculture in 1992, we now produce all kinds of fruits and vegetables. We convert a part of our fruit into juices, the rest is consumed locally. Our juices are always made of apple since it is a very watery fruit. Then we blend it with other of the fruits we produce in the farm."
